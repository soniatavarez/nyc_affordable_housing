# NYC Affordable Housing

For my Data Warehousing and Analytics course, I completed a project that involved sourcing data, creating an ETL pipeline via python scripts, and visualizing the results using a business intelligence tool. I used DataGrip, Azure Cloud Storage, PostgreSQL, DbSchema, and Tableau for this project.
